## 1. Project Summary
### * Website Chose to Update
[**Big Brisket Barbecue Website:** _https://bigbrisketbarbecue.com/_](https://bigbrisketbarbecue.com/)
### * Reason for New Website
* **Purpose**: to effectively communicate the brand and attract customers.
* **Target Audience**:  
The primary audiences include food lovers and barbecue enthusiasts, while people who live in the vicinity of the Big Brisket Barbecue, tourists and visitors, corporate event planners could also be the target audiences. 
* **Message to Convey and Expected User Actions**:  
The overall message to convey is that the brisket barbecue is the best in town, offering high-quality, mouthwatering barbecue for any occasion.  
Users are expected to take the following actions before they leave the website: placing orders online, visiting the physical address for dine-in or takeout orders, or leaving positive word-of-mouth reviews to improve online reputation.
* **Original Website Analysis**:  
While the original website performs well in performance (93 scores) and accessibility (only a few issues such as missing alternative text) tests, it still needs improvement to address the following issues:
    * **Decreased readability and maintainability**: excessive `<div>` elements are used, making it harder to understand and maintain the code.  
    **_Improvement_**: Use elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>` to structure the content semantically.
    * **Inappropriate content organization**: The content of the homepage is too complicated and the structure is not clear, whereas those of other two pages are too simple, which leads to a poor user experience.  
    **_Improvement_**: Reorganize the content to make more meaningful. See [Website Content](#3WebsiteContent) below for details.
## 2. Look and Feel
* **Mood**: Mouthwatering and Inviting
* **Inspiration**:
    * [https://saltlickbbq.com/](https://saltlickbbq.com/)   
    ![Homepage](./images/example-saltlickbbq.jpg "Homepage of https://saltlickbbq.com/")
    * [https://franklinbbq.com/](https://franklinbbq.com/)  
    ![Homepage](./images/example-franklinbbq.jpg "Homepage of https://franklinbbq.com/")
* **Colours**:
    * For primary color, a **deep and rich red** can be used for the primary text, buttons, and other prominent elements, which represents the hearty nature of barbecue.
    * For natural colors, a **warm brown** represents reliability and the natural ingredients of BBQ, which could be used for the background and supporting elements, while a **soft off-white** can be used for text, subtle elements and some background as it provides a clean and inviting contrast to the darker colors.
    * For highlight color, a **vibrant orange** can be used for call-to-action buttons, special offers and some important elements.
* **Images**: The logo can be reused from original website with resizing, and some barbecue images can also be reused.
* **Fonts**: _Playfair Display SC_ will be used for headlines, and _Roboto_ for body copy.
