# HTML/CSS Project: [Big Brisket Barbecue Website](https://bigbrisketbarbecue.com/) Improvement
## Current Website Analysis
There are several problems in the current website that need to be improved, as follows:
* Too many \<div\> elements were used in the website, which could be replaced with \<header\>, \<main\>, and \<footer\> etc.
* The layout of content of each web page is inappropriate. The content on the homepage is too complicated and the structure is unclear, which seriously affects user experience, while contents of other two web pages are too simple.
## Improvement Plan
### * Home Page
1. Header: includes logo and navigation list.
2. Hero Section: uses a mouth-watering image of a smoked brisket as background, and adds a strong headline with a clear call-to-action to grab users' attention.
3. About Us Section: includes two sub-sections as current website, "What we do" and "Who are we?". If possible, replaces the original images with videos.
4. Benefits Section: includes a headline such as "Signature Dishes", lists two or three menu items, and adds a call-to-action button, like "View All".
5. Testimonials Section: adds a short testimonials from satisfied clients, with a headline, "What Our Customers Say".
6. Footer: includes contact information, such as phone number, address, email, and social media links.
